Lax is a simple parallax section that will allow for parallaxed background images as the user scrolls down the page. 

It supports nested sections as well as some basic content options. 

A very nice scroll effect that is sure to impress your users.

Note: There are some issues when using this section with other sticky sections as it places an image in the background of the page.
